1.) Try to figure out an efficient and accurate regex search for searching posts and other items by either 
selected parameters or simply by the text entered into the searcvh bar!!!

2.)Get good with the javascript Array.reduce() function! It may come in handy one day!

3.) Make it to where the user can only request a comment to be made, and therefore cannot directly post a comment to the page via the web UI. Instead, it sends an email to me
via a node.js microservice that I will have deployed to fly.io that will send me an email back with a copy to clipboard button attached to it via generated HTML and javascript from the service's code
that can be used to copy the message off of the email, onto my device clipboard, and then be published via an administration mobile app that I will create after I deem it appropriate for public display.
