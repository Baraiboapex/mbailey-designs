            who specializes in front-end development but also enjoys going full-stack to employ my 
            wizardry on those tech stacks as well be it Node.js or C# .NET! (I'm working on 'getting gud'
            with python and php as well! ;) ) Besides my absolute banger skillz with tech, I am also a HUGE 
            meat connoisseur and look forward to one day tasting jamon iberico and culatello di zebillio! 
            (Not that you needed to know that) When I am not coding, I am most likely practicing taekwondo, 
            gaming, or just enjoying some time in the great outdoors! Because my pasty white computer nerd 
            skin needs some vitamin D too, right?`
