            content:`Welp, there you are. Autistic, struggling to get out of your parent's basement, probably doubting yourself because
            you *FEEL* like your life sucks. Your contract or last gig ended because you were layed off due to circumstances beyond your control
            You're either collecting unemployment (after fighting to get it at least in the state of Florida) while at the same time trying to find 
            some desperate way to impress some chick you met a little while back about your "awesome career choice" (yeah good luck with that considering your circumstances ;) )  
            you feel like a failure at life, and a *ehem* "Gil Gunderson", who by the way, is one of my favorite characters from the Simpsons because his situations are just 
            so hilariously (and unrealistically) unfortunate that you often wonder when he's ever going to get a break (I can do a near-perfect impression of him, but I'm not 
            going to upload an audio file any time soon, sorry).`,
